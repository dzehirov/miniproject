### 6. Static
#### Static methods in Python are extremely similar to python class level methods, the difference being that a static method is bound to a class rather than the objects for that class. This means that a static method can be called without an object for that class. This also means that static methods cannot modify the state of an object as they are not bound to it. Letâ€™s see how we can create static methods in Python.

### 7. Property/Attribute
#### In Python, property() is a built-in function that creates and returns a property object. where, fget is function to get value of the attribute, fset is function to set value of the attribute, fdel is function to delete the attribute and doc is a string (like a comment). An attribute in Python means some possessions that are linked with a particular type of object. Putting it differently, the attributes of a given object are that abilities and data that each object type integrally possesses.
