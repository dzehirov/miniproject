## Git Set-Up Tutorial
This is a guide on how to set up Git so it can be used to work collaboratively with a group of people. It is assumed that the user will have already installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and created an account on [github.com](github.com).
- The first step to making sure that you will be able to collaborate with others is to set up your SSH key and link it to your [github account](https://github.com/settings/keys). Having an SSH key set up means that you will be able to clone other people's repositories and then push any changes that you make back into the master.
  - Before this, you must check for an existing SSH key in your system, and if one does not exist, then you will create one. To check, you must open your terminal or Git Bash and type in *ls -al ~/.ssh*. This will list the files in your .ssh directory, if it exists. If it does not exist, you must create a new one.
  - To create a new SSH key, type *ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096* and enter through all the prompts. Do not set up a password as it can get tedious having to enter it at every push.
  - Now, to add your SSH key to your account, you must copy the key and paste it into the field. The easiest and cleanest way to get the key is to go to the terminal and enter *clip <~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub*. This copies the exact text that needs to be pasted into the **Key** field in order to connect it. Now that your SSH key is set up, you can clone and make changes to your group members' projects.
